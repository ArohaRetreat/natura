# Aroha website and host studio

Owner: ArohaRetreat. Source: website/. Entries: site.mjs, admin.mjs, render.mjs; field-render.mjs owns the public layout and map; field-journey.mjs owns native scrolling and playback; field.css owns its design. Earlier spatial/cinematic renderers remain in source for comparison. Build: npm run build:website; full shared Hosting build: npm run build. Website version 0.8.0 is independent of Natura 0.6.0. Read [plan](../../docs/website-plan.md), [API](../../docs/api/aroha-v1.md), [observability](../../docs/website-observability.md) and [continuation](continuation.md).

The enquiry-led public website has a photographic film tour and a document fallback, Simple View, cottages, experiences, packages, gallery and practical information. WhatsApp receives a guest-reviewed enquiry; there is no payment, inventory check, room hold or booking confirmation. Preserve Natura identity/fonts and Hrudhi. Do not fabricate property geometry or label an unrelated photograph as a particular room.

Version 1 data is validated by functions/domain.mjs; seed is website/content.json. Escape all text. Bound images to local retreat derivatives or this Firebase Storage bucket. Public clients read only aroha_public/site. The build seed supplies first render and fallback; live client metadata updates from Firestore, but pre-rendered social previews follow the build seed.

The studio uses session-scoped Google sign-in and API-enforced membership. Super-admin/admin publishes, editor saves drafts/uploads media, viewer reads. Structured controls cover content, photographs, section order/visibility, theme and motion, excluding executable code. Saves use expected versions; conflicts preserve work for backup. Preview validates sender/origin. Publishing is explicit; restore creates a draft. Uploaded media is immediately public and immutable, disclosed before upload.

Edited masters remain outside this public repository. Edited WebP derivatives and silent SDR web film editions ship. Desktop/mobile hero images are separate settings. The photographic palm cutout remains excluded; the new foreground palm illustration has transparent source artwork. See [photography](../../docs/website-photography.md).

Run npm run test:website, npm test, emulator integration, OTLP tests and browser review. AROHA_EMULATORS=1 builds local-only synthetic sign-in controls; production bundles must omit those controls. Emulator and iframe checks do not certify real Google OAuth or physical devices.

Firebase routes: /, /admin/, /api/v1 and preserved /design/. Shared releases must contain both sites; deploy-design.mjs requires the root manifest. Hosting rollback and content-history restore are separate operations. Never automatically roll back memberships or delete immutable media. Public RUM requires an approved script and consent; privileged tokens and enquiry details never enter frontend telemetry.

Read [spatial direction](../../docs/website-spatial-direction.md) before changing the camera or scene. No scroll interception. Preserve native vertical touch scrolling, scene disposal on replacement, pause on modal/hidden/offscreen, section position when toggling views, and a readable fallback after context loss. Scene graphics are interpretations, never a surveyed map or authentic room interior.

Current public entry uses field-render.mjs / field-journey.mjs / field.css and the optional validated tour contract. Read [film direction](../../docs/website-film-direction.md). Preserve all supplied photo/video journal coverage and native playback/motion fallbacks. See continuation for the production schema/rule prerequisite.

The living layer uses nature-render.mjs, botanical-motion.mjs, welcome.mjs and living.css. Read docs/website-living-direction.md before editing. The sprout is Natura’s shared germination drawing; generated botanical art is decorative and never a claimed exact farm specimen. Preserve bounded welcome cleanup, native reversible panel motion, fixed reading controls, deferred image sources and a single active film.

Revision 0.7 layers arrival.css over the public styling and hero-atmosphere.mjs over the hero. Keep the original germination player alive until the leaf aperture finishes. Calligraphy uses Natura’s local Allura only for short Latin invitations; never controls/body/Kannada. Evening photography is a guest-triggered editorial state, loaded on selection and guarded against stale decoding. Read the continuous-arrival section of the living direction before changing startup.

The compact gallery uses album.mjs and collections.css. Preserve all media, filter-scoped viewer navigation, five-entry paging, state retention and original-target focus restoration after CMS repaints. The same stylesheet owns the pricing card surfaces/subgrid; do not alter tariffs to style cards.
